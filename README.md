The [`embedding`](https://github.com/logtalk-actions/spider/blob/master/.github/workflows/embedding.yml) workflow generates a GNU Prolog based macOS executable from the [`spider`](https://github.com/LogtalkDotOrg/logtalk3/tree/master/examples/adventure) text adventure game distributed with Logtalk. The executable is made available for downloading as a build artifact.
