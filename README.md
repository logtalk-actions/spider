# `spider`

Demo repo for a Logtalk application embedding workflow.

![](https://github.com/logtalk-actions/spider/workflows/Embedding/badge.svg)

The [`embedding`](https://github.com/logtalk-actions/spider/blob/master/.github/workflows/embedding.yml) workflow generates a GNU Prolog based macOS executable from the [`spider`](https://github.com/LogtalkDotOrg/logtalk3/tree/master/examples/adventure) text adventure game distributed with Logtalk. The executable is made available for downloading as a build artifact (navigate to the [commits](https://github.com/logtalk-actions/spider/commits/master) list and click on the green check arrow of the latest successful build and then click on the details link). Use the `spider::start` goal to start the game.
